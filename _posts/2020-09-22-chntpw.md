My dad lost the password to his old Windows Vista computer.  This was a computer that was no longer using.  He wanted to make sure that he got all the photos off of it.

I downloaded [SystemRescueCd](https://www.system-rescue.org/System-tools/)

I burned the ISO file to a flash drive using Ubuntu Disk utility with the "Restore disk Image..." option.  Ejected.

Popped it into the Vista computer.  It boots up linux.   I figured out which drive and partition was the windows is `fdisk -l` pointed me to `/dev/sda3`,  I figured because it was the largest drive and it was bootable.  Next, I located the file named `sam`, which was in the default location  `\Windows\System32\config`

First, I backed up the file `sam` (by executing `cp sam sam.backup-2020-09-21`). Then, I used `chntpw -i sam`.  This is a command line tool that allows the user to interactively edit blank the passwords through a menu system.  First, I had to unlock the user.  Then, I could clear the password.  You have say "yes" you want to write the out to "the hive files". 

Restarted the system.  Booted Windows Vista. Logged in and the user was able to get in without a password.

The password was successfully blanked.  SystemRescueCd made quick work of this.

Step one complete: gaining access.  Getting the data off of it might be a whole different issue. I booted up and the system was pegged at 100% CPU.
