## Motivations for a building a NAS
Mainly, I wanted a platform for my DVD/Blu Ray collection that is just as convenient as Netflix.  So, a Plex Media Server or Kodi setup. 

To the end user, Plex looks very similar to Netflix, Amazon Prime, and most other streaming services.  The difference is the video source is streaming from content stored on a NAS box through the LAN. 

I repurposed an old unusued desktop PC (that I built from parts in 2007) into a home Network Attached Storage (NAS).  With a few inexpensive upgrades and a few hard drives I could have an okay NAS.  This could serve as a jumping off point for eventually upgrading to better hardware. I have grown to appreciate giving old hardware new life.  It is somewaht eco-friendly.  (Probably not as the power consumption goes.)

What are some of the old technologies in the system:
  - USB 2.0
  - PCIe 1.0
  - BIOS (instead of UEFI)
  - Wireless card is 802.11g (AKA Wi-Fi 3)
  - Rudementary support for PWM fans only for CPU fan, not the case fans.

What is sufficient about the system:
  + Onboard Gigabit Ethernet
  + 64-bit AMD processor (modern binaries, no 2 TB storage limit)
  + SATA 2


Trying to figure out what is the worst bottleneck was interesting exercise in math and benchmarking.  I came to the conclusion that USB 2.0 and the 802.11g Wi-Fi have been the biggest bottlenecks. (Both can be minimized, when the systems is connect by ethernet.)

## Upgrades 
I upgrade the RAM from 4 GB to 6 GB.  It has 4 RAM slots, which per the manual accept a maximum of 2 GB per slot.  I bought an additional 2 GB, but found out one slot does not work. :-(

The system was a little too loud due to fan noise. The existing heatsink ran off of a variable fan controller. So, I upgraded the heat sink and ran its fan off of the PWM header of the motherboard, and that made it a little quieter.  The fan blowing air out of the case ran particularly loud, so I replaced that fan.  The new fan was still a little loud, so I put a variable speed controller on it and turned it down to nearly silent.  These measure made the system reasonably quiet.  At idle, which temperature is about 34°C for the CPU and motherboard, which is just fine.

I purchased 4 x 4 TB NAS hard drives 3.5" SATA 3.  (One drive was used for backup.)
I purchased 1 x 120 GB SSD SATA.  This was to run the Operating System.

The motherboard support 4 SATA connectors, so that was the maximum amount of drives that I would be getting on this system without a SATA/SAS card/expander.  The case probably won't support more drives.  (I could remove optical drive with the other empty 5 1/4" slot and get atleast 2 more space for drives, which could be hotswapable.  I don't think it is worth the trouble/expense.)

## Testing
First, I did some hardware testing.  How can you make sure that an old system will run reliably without a little bit of testing?

I ran Memtest86 on the RAM.  This is a test to make sure that the RAM isn't spiting out erroneous results.

I installed MX Linux to test the hard drives.  I tested `badblocks -wvsb 4096 /dev/sdX` on three of the drives.  This software writes 4 different patterns on the hard drive and reads those back.  It is in an effort to find bad blocks.  I let that run about a week—the first pass had completed—and gave up.  It probably would have taken 3-4 weeks to entirely test the drives.

Extended S.M.A.R.T. testing was performed on each drive.

This seem to be a sufficent battery of tests for my purposes.

## NAS Software
I wanted to use Proxmox to allow for VMs, but I was unable to get it to boot on the old system.  I assume this the hardware being a BIOS system, and that Proxmox may only boot on UEFI.  There could be some other incompatibility(-ies).  Instead, I chose OpenMediaVault (OMV).  It is NAS software built on top of Debian Linux.  Also, I would have had to ran an OS/NAS OS under Proxmox.

Being built on Debian Linux has made it easy to add software packages as needed with `apt` package manager.

Other uses for the NAS:  It is great to have one place in the home LAN to store files.  Also, [[docker containers]] are being run off of it (Plex Media Server runs in a docker container).

Plex Media Server has very little setup.  Install the docker container and then point it to the folder location on for the media—TV shows, movies, music, and so on—is at on the NAS.  Install the app on the device.  There is a code that pairs the device to the media server.  Once paired, it just works.   The media server has a plex account associated with it.  The pairing process make it easy to add devices.

All in all, I have been pleased with OpenMediaVault.  It could be a little more intuitive with regard to how you initially setup the storage, but overall it just works.


## Storage
I set this up with OMV's default configuration of software RAID 5 with 3 hard disk.  This worked seemingly fine.  Until, I learned about RAID's write hole.  A write hole is a condition that occurs when a file is being written to the RAID array and portions are written to one disk but not another. This could occur when writing data to the RAID array and the power is going out.   The Linux software RAID's solution to this inconsistency between this disk is to rebuild the entire array, which could result in data loss.  (Not having some big warning about the "risk of using a software RAID" is perhaps my biggest complaint about OMV.)

After finding out about what a RAID write hole was and that software RAID is succeptible, I quickly decided to switch my RAID array to ZFS.   OpenMediaVault has a plugin for ZFS, which made it pretty easy to install and OMV to support it.  In order to make the conversion to ZFS, I backuped up the RAID array, built a ZFS volume, and restored from backup onto the ZFS volume.  (I hope that future versions of OMV may make ZFS the default file system, but that seems to be TrueNAS's domain.)

This configuration has 12 TB raw hard drive capacity. I configured it for RAIDz1 in ZFS, which is similar to a RAID 5 configuration with approximately 1 drive is being used for parity (out of 3 total drives used on the array/volume).

 The resulted in a ZFS pool of about 7 TB of usable space.

## Shares
I used OpenMediaVault to create shared network folders using SMB and NFS.  I've made read-only shares without login, and read-write shares password protected.  The read-only shares consist of data that isn't really private, such as Music, Movies, and TV Shows.

## Backup
See [[Backup]]
I chose the single copy backup strategy for the moment. I use one 4 TB hard drive with shell script with an `rsync` command.  I use `cp` with a few additional commands to restore the files to a drive/pool/volume.  I figured out restoring the ZFS array. I'm keeping a simple copy strategy, not anything complicated for the moment. 

I'll have to make changes once the amount of data exceeds 4TB.  Either get a 8TB hard drive for backup or buy another 4TB hard drive.  Or switch to another backup strategy such as incremental backup. Or start diverting media not needed on the NAS to hard drives, such as rippped video content.

Later, I obtained a USB 3.0 PCIe card (version 2.0).  I installed the card and it worked.  This increased transfer speeds by about a factor of 2-3.  However, adding this card had a side effect, the PCI Wi-Fi card to not work. I am not too sure why. I did try all the combinations of places to arrange the PCIe and PCI cards. A not working PCI Wi-Fi card would be fine if I were not using that for the NAS's network access.   In the future, I will probably connect it with Ethernet, which will make this a non-issue.

Some of these issues will push me to upgrade to newer hardware, the only having one expansion card that works, the RAM slot not working, and not much ability to upgrade.  If I find it is using too much power, I may upgrade for that reason alone.

## Settings
I did set the hard drives to go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.  This seems like it is a reasonable compromise between power efficiency and speed.

## Maintenance
Weekly update the OS:
```shell
# apt update
# apt upgrade
```
On a monthly basis:
* scrub the ZFS array
  * Unneeded, looks like there is a cron job for this on second Sunday of the month.
* clean the dust filter

About every three months:
* Check S.M.A.R.T. hard drive status if a hard drive is showing signs of failure.

## Future Additions:
* Buy a Watt Meter (to size the battery backup, and measure the present efficiency)
  * UPS Battery Backup  (How much power does the current hardware use?)
  * Newer and more power efficient computer.
* Perhaps server hardware with ECC memory.  (Some source state that ZFS system should run on ECC because it may protect from bit-rot.)
* Motherboard with more option for PWM and fan curve adjustments for all fans, so that it will be quieter.
* Case upgrades
  * A case that is easier to work on. The current case makes it really difficult to get at the filter.  The front panel of the case has to be remove from screws inside of the case.  Not a good design.
  * A case that supports more drives.
* A SATA or SAS controller/expander to support more drives.
  * Hotswap bays might be nice.
* I should probably learn a little more about ZFS Snapshots, and evalute the benefits for my system.
* Plex supports trancoding video, which is the server doing a realtime conversion from larger video to smaller video, so 1080p to 480p.  An example would be watching Blu Ray content on a cell phone.  In order to do this, the system would require a computer upgrade.  Consumer processors and video cards have extra features that enable this ability,  Intel QuickSync, NVIDIA, AMD.  This motherboard would have to be upgraded to support those video cards.  I don't have a need for this, but it is a consideration for anyone setting up a home NAS.  The conversion can be put back onto this playing device, so Kodi let's the playing device resize the content.
