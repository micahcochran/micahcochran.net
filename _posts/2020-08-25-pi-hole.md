## DNS Filter

![Pi-hole's Web interface](/assets/img/pihole_screenshot.png "Pi-hole's Web interface")

Pi-hole is DNS filter software.  The software's primary purpose is for blocking ads block, but it will also block known malware sites.
The name comes from the Raspberry Pi single board computer (SBC) platform.  However, it can be installed on most platforms that run Linux.

How the software works: It compares incoming DNS requests to its blocklist domain/AKA gravity--a denied list of domain names that serve ads.  The gravity list is pi-hole's own terminology. If the domain is on the gravity list it returns 0.0.0.0 for that domain's IP address, otherwise, Pi-hole resolves the proper IP address.

See [Footnote](#footnote) regarding why I am not using the terms blacklist and whitelist to describe this.


## Hardware

I decided it would be best to use the Raspberry Pi Zero to create this platform.  It is inexpensive and power effiencent.  Others have use this platform, too.

All the parts went together quickly and without any surprises.


## Installation
I installed Raspbian, which is a disto of Debian Linux for the Raspberry Pi Platform.  I installed Buster Lite image, which is 2.2 GB uncompressed, using the SD Card port in my laptop to write to the MicroSD card.  Raspbian has an option to create a empty text file called "ssh" on the MicroSD card in the "/" directory which automatically enables SSH.  (Raspbian enables the SSH service and deletes the "ssh" file.)   There is a default username/password.

When I logged in via SSH, the first item of business was to change the password.
Next, update the operating system, so "$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade".
Then install Pihole software. I gave the Pi-hole a static address and told it which DNS servers it should use upstream.  From there I went to my router and changed the DNS server to the Raspberry PI's static IP address.  It worked.  Finally, upload a public SSH key from my laptop, so that I can login without a password.

The Pi-hole software has a command line interface (CLI) and a web interface.  The web interface contains graphs and is very easy to use.  The CLI is fairly easy, too.  Updates can be done from the web interface or at the CLI "$ pihole updatePihole".

![iperf3 speed test](/assets/img/pihole_iperf3.png "iperf3 speed test")

I performed a speed test using iperf3, and found that the transfer speed was about 6 to 7 Mbit/sec. On a Gigabit network this is slow, but from a user point of view it speeds up web browsing due to not downloading ads.  I don't know if the bottleneck is on the Raspberry Pi Hardware or the Ethernet adaptor (it isn't the network), but it is more than sufficent for DNS for my household. 

I guess a DNS query is no more than 512 bytes. 
Covert units into bytes
6 Mbit/sec / 8 = 750 KB/s 

divide by big DNS packet.
750 KB/s / 512 =  1442.3 DNS queries

This really only covers if those DNS queries are cached or on the gravity list (ban list).  Is the pi-hole software fast enough to do that as they come in.

Maybe it can do a 3rd of that.  (There's transfers to query a DNS server.)  So 400 DNS queries per second, still seems pretty good for a household. 

## Assessment
This computer has been in service since September 2019.  It works as advertised.  It reduces the number of ads, which makes some websites more useable and faster.  It does not entirely eliminate ads.  This box provides a measure of protection against domains that serve maleware.

The gravity list is updated early Sunday as a cron job.  That is a default configuration for Pi-hole that I happen to discover when poking around cron jobs.

At one point, the Pi-hole stopped working.  I couldn't figure out why.  I figured out how reliant upon it that I had become.  I ordered a Micro-HDMI (male goes into the Raspberry Pi) to HDMI adapter (female) in order to hook it up to a TV.  I hooked it up and it had a linux boot conole with a login prompt.  Everything looked just fine.  What I discovered wsas that only one of the Micro-USB ports accepts the USB power.  I had swapped them.

## Customization
Since this machine is usually accessed by ssh, I added temperature on the bash prompt to get a quick feel for how hot the hardware is running.
``` bash
# Show temperature on bash prompt
# Inspiration: https://askubuntu.com/questions/15832/how-do-i-get-the-cpu-temperature

get_cpu_temperature() {
   cat /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp |  sed 's/\(.\)..$/.\1°C/'
}

if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
    PS1='$(get_cpu_temperature) ${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w \$\[\033[00m\] '
else
    PS1='$(get_cpu_temperature) ${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi
``` 

The resulting prompt looks like this:

![bash prompt with temperature](/assets/img/pihole_bash_prompt_temperature.png "bash prompt with temperature")


When updating it will get up to 45°C, which is fairly cool for a CPU.

## Improvements
I installed a piece of software that would reduce the amount of logging on to the MicroSD Card called log2ram.  It stores the system logs in memory, and runs a cron job daily that writes those logs to disk.  On most systems, these logs are written to disk almost immediately.  The purpose of this is to extend life expenctancy of the MicroSD Card, which are not intended to be written to as much as a computer's hard disk.

A few months later, I improved the setup by set up a [docker container] on my NAS machine so that I could have a second instance of pi-hole on that machine.  I set that IP address as the secondary DNS.  This increased the DNS service reliability.  Now, there are two machines that will respond with DNS, slightly reducing the points for my home's DNS filter.

## Maintence
I do maintenance on it every Friday due to it being home infrastructure.  This gives me the most time to fix the problem.  So, I do `$ sudo apt update` and `$ sudo apt upgrade`.  I check to see if the latest version of pihole is installed with `$ pihole -v`. If there is an update for the Pi-hole software, run `$ pihole updatePihole`. 

## Inspiration
I saw a video that detailed the step by step process of installation and why you would want to do this (["Block EVERY Online Ad with THIS - Pi-Hole on Raspberry Pi". Linus Tech Tips. YouTube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4)).  I followed it along with its [tutorial post](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/1094810-pi-hole-setup-tutorial/). 


## Final Thoughts (and What would I do differently?)
At some point, I would like to try the  DietPI disto, which is lighter weight on the memory card at 440 MB versus Raspbian's 2.2 GB.  The current setup is working, so I'm not in a rush to tinker.  I might wait until it needs to be upgraded from the most current Debian distro that Raspbian is based on, codename Buster or version 10.

Give it a static IP address that's outside of the dynamic address range given out by DHCP.  (Oops.)  I'll be forced to fix that at some point.

The physical case isn't quite what I expected. It works, but the case is a little on the flimsy side for my taste. The case has a removable plastic section for the pin headers, which I have no need for. 

![Night shot of network adapater (orange) and the Raspberry Pi Zero's power led (green)](/assets/img/pihole_light.jpg "Night shot of network adapater (orange) and the Raspberry Pi Zero's power led (green)")

The network adapater is underwhelming.  It was advertised as 100 Mbit, but the network performace is ho-hum at a not quite 10 Mbit/sec.  The ethernet's light illuminates the entire body of the network adapter, which was unexpected.

I am considering replacing the Raspberry Pi Zero with a Single Board Computer with an onboard ethernet adapter that can perform be closer to 100 Mbit/sec. Reducing latency could make the internet connection feel a little faster.

This has made me realize that I need to do some firewall tweaks.  It appears that outside DNS traffic is getting through my router. It is a consumer grade unit.  Installing OpenWRT firmware is one option, but another is buying a computer and install a pfSense firewall, which could also add IDS capabilities.

## Footnote
Note: I have revised the way that I describe this from how I learned how this worked.  This is due to the  terms whitelist and blacklist have racist overtones and should be replaced.  The terms "allow list" and "deny list" are by used by a UK Cybersecurity Agency ([Reference 1](#references), [Reference 2](#references)).  "Block list" could another alternative for blacklist ([Reference 3](#references)).
