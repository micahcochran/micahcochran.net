The Question Answering System created SPARQL queries based on the question and executed those queries on a Knowledge Graph to get an answer.  A Knowledge graph was created for Zoning Ordinance laws.  

### [Legal Text Website](/projects/legal-text/)

<a href="/projects/legal-text/"><img src="/images/resume/legal_text-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* October 2021 to December 2021
* I led a four person team to build a software that did agricultural drone scanning.  The software simulated a flight on the screen and also flew a physical drone.  My team explored the software development process with use cases, drawing state charts, and implementation of the software in [Java](/tags/Java/) & JavaFX.  The project was for the CS 520 Software Engineering class.

### [pyproj](https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj)
* 2016 to 2019
* Python library for cartographic projection and spatial transformation.  Cython is used as a wrapper for the C library PROJ.
