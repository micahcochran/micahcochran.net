## Projects

### [Zoning Ordinance Question Answering](/projects/zoning-qa/)
<ul>
    <li>October to December 2022</li>
    <li>Team project created a Knowledge Graph Question Answering System.  The software answered natural language questions about Zoning Ordinance laws. The Question Answering System recognized the question matched it to a template, found key words, and filled the key words into slots in the SPARQL query. The queries were executed on a Zoning Ordinance Knowledge Graph to obtain the answer.  The class project was for CS&nbsp;662 Natural Language Processing.</li>
</ul>

### [Legal Text Website](/projects/legal-text/)

<a href="/projects/legal-text/"><img src="/images/resume/legal_text-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* June to August 2022
* Present legal codes in a more usable website. Scraped the Constitution of Alabama using the BeautifulSoup library.  Features of this website were displaying legal text, searching, section links, and a user registration system.  Technologies used in this project include: [Python](/tags/Python/), [Flask](/tags/Flask/), and [MongoDB](/tags/MongoDB/).

### [Agricultural Drone Dashboard](/projects/drone/)

* October 2021 to December 2021
* Led a four (4) person team that built software for agricultural drone scanning.  The software simulated a flight on the screen and also flew a physical drone.  The team explored the software development process with use cases, state charts, and implementing the software in [Java](/tags/Java/) and JavaFX.  <abbr title="Object-oriented programming">OOP</abbr> patterns were also incorporated into this project.  This was the final project for the [CS 520 Software Engineering class](#Select-Coursework).

### [recipe-crawler](/projects/recipe-crawler/)
* June 2021 to present
* A [Python](/tags/Python/) web crawler for recipes in HTML [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) (Microdata/<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD)</abbr>, which output cookbooks in JSON format for testing recipe software.  Uses [scrape-schema-recipe](/projects/recipe/) library for parsing recipes and Beautiful Soup library for parsing anchor tags.
* I programmed the software and maintain the repository.

### [request_builder.py](https://github.com/micahcochran/request_builder_py)
<a href="https://github.com/micahcochran/request_builder_py"><img src="/images/resume/PC_Agenda_250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* 2020 to August 2021
* Command line software that generates agendas and notices using Word Document templates from applicant requests (PDF files).  The [Python](/tags/Python/) software used the PDF form data to fill templates of agendas and public notices.  Templates were tailored to City's processes and messaging.
* Programmer and user of software.

### [scrape-schema-recipe](/projects/recipe/)
<a href="/projects/recipe/"><img src="/images/resume/ssr-dict-recipe-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* 2018 to present
* Scrapes recipes from HTML [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) (Microdata/JSON-LD) into [Python](/tags/Python/) dictionaries. This is an open source library that allows others to use this to build software from this tool.
* Programmed the software and maintain the repository.

### [pyproj](https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj)
* 2016 to 2019
* Python library for cartographic projection and spatial transformation that wraps the PROJ C library using Cython to interface between the C library and the Python.
* Provided support for end users (programmers), wrote documentation, contributed fixes, wrote unit tests, reviewed user contributions, and merged contributions.


### [combined_municipal_limits_geoprocessing](/projects/limits/)
* 2014 to 2016
* A Python <abbr title="Extract Transform Load">ETL</abbr> script to combine <abbr title="Geographic Information Systems">GIS</abbr> municipal limit data from four (4) different sources.  The data had two (2) projections and four (4) schemas.  The script was to create one layer with one projection and [one schema](/pdfs/gis_municipal_boundary_schema.pdf).  The result was a single layer of municipal limits that covered Limestone County, AL.
* Programmer and user.

### [GIS Maps](/projects/gismaps/)
<a href="/projects/gismaps/"><img src="/images/resume/trail_map-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* 2004 to 2022
* 18 years of creating and maintaining <abbr title="Geographic Information Systems">GIS</abbr> data and cartographic products.
