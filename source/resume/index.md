## Projects

### [Zoning Ordinance Question Answering](/projects/zoning-qa/)		
* October to December 2022
* Team project to create a system that answers natural language questions about Zoning Ordinance laws.  The Question Answering System created SPARQL queries based on the question and executed those queries on a Knowledge Graph to get an answer.  A Knowledge graph was created for Zoning Ordinance laws.

### [Legal Text Website](/projects/legal-text/)

<a href="/projects/legal-text/"><img src="/images/resume/legal_text-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* June to August 2022 
* Scrape the Constitution of Alabama and create website that presents legal codes in a more usable website format.  Features of this website were display legal text, searching, section links, and a users registration system.  Technologies used in this project include: [Python](/tags/Python/), Flask, and MongoDB.

### [Agricultural Drone Dashboard](/projects/drone/)

<a href="/projects/drone/"><img src="/images/resume/ag_drone-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* October 2021 to December 2021
* Led a four person team to build a software that did agricultural drone scanning.  The software simulated a flight on the screen and also flew a physical drone.  My team explored the software development process with use cases, state charts, and implementing the software in [Java](/tags/Java/) and JavaFX.  This was the final project for the <a href="#Select-Coursework">CS&nbsp;520 Software Engineering class</a>.

### [recipe-crawler](/projects/recipe-crawler/)
* June 2021 to present
* A [Python](/tags/Python/) web crawler for recipes in HTML [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) (Microdata/<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data">JSON-LD)</abbr>, which output cookbooks in JSON format.  Beautiful Soup library is used to get the anchor tags from HTML.  [scrape-schema-recipe](/projects/recipe/) library (below) is used to get the recipes from HTML. 
    * I programmed the software and maintain the repository.

### request_builder.py
* 2020 to August 2021
* Command line software that generates agendas and notices using Word Document templates from applicant requests.  The requests were PDF applications.  The Python software used the PDF input to generates agendas and public notices filling in the templates.  Templates were tailored to City of Athens processes and messaging.
* Programmer and user of software.

### [scrape-schema-recipe](/projects/recipe/)
<a href="/projects/recipe/"><img src="/images/resume/ssr-dict-recipe-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* 2018 to present
* Scrapes recipes from HTML [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) (Microdata/JSON-LD) into Python dictionaries. This is an open source library that allows others to use this to build software from this tool.  I programmed the software and maintain the repository.

### [pyproj](https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj)
* 2016 to 2019
* Python library for cartographic projection and spatial transformation.  Cython is used as a wrapper for the C library PROJ.
* Provided support for end users (programmers), wrote documentation, contributed fixes, wrote unit tests, reviewed user contributions, and merged contributions.


### municipal_limits_geoprocess.py
* 2014 to 2016
* An extract transform load (<abbr>ETL</abbr>) Python script for City limit Geographic Information Systems (<abbr>GIS</abbr>) data from four (4) different sources.  The data had two (2) different projections and four (4) schemas.  The script was to create one layer with one projection and [one schema](/pdfs/gis_municipal_boundary_schema.pdf).  Replaced a GeoKettle ETL script with a less proprietary system.  This script lead to making open source contributions to geospatial libraries in this period of time, namely [pyproj](#pyproj) (above).  Learned about the utility of Python virtual environments the hard way.
* Programmer and user.

### [GIS Maps](/projects/gismaps/)
<a href="/projects/gismaps/"><img src="/images/resume/trail_map-250px.webp" class="resume-prj-img"></a>

* 2004 to 2022
* 18 years of creating and maintaining <abbr title="Geographic Information Systems">GIS</abbr> data and cartographic products.
