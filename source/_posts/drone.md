Led a team of four to create a software that did agricultural drone scanning. The software simulated a flight on the screen and also flew a physical drone. My team explored the software development process starting with use cases, wireframes, drawing state charts, and implementation of the software in Java & JavaFX. This flew an actual drone. The project was for the CS 520 Software Engineering class.

Object Oriented design patterns Adapter, Singleton, and Visitor were implemented in this project. The project used a Model-View-Control (MVC) architecture.

For all team member it was their first time using Java. For the rest of the team it was their first time using git.
JUnit was used for unit testing to ensure that merge requests did not causing testable problems.
