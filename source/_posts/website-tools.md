Heres a selection of the software used to create this website:

* [hexo](https://hexo.io/) - static site generator
    * [Minima hexo theme](https://github.com/adisaktijrs/hexo-theme-minima)
* [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - create a favicon
* ImageMagick - used with in a shell script (fish) to create thumbnails of the PDF files

[Feather](https://feathericons.com/) icons are used on my resume.

Here's software that is used on this website that has a Javascript component (and occasionally needs updating):
* [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)-player - records and plays back the captured terminal sessions
* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) - code syntax highlighting
